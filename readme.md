# Javascript examples

These are javascript modules I have written while following learning JS on CodeAcademy. I have only uploaded scripts that required very basic instructions. I'd love feedback on them, and please let me know if anything weird happens!


## Number guessing game

This is a simple number guessing game created following [CodeAcademy's challenge project](https://www.codecademy.com/projects/practice/number-guesser-independent-practice).

It runs in the browser by opening "index.html" - I wrote it on MacOS Monterey (v12.4) in Visual Studio Code 1.68.1, and tested in Chrome Version 103.0.5060.53 (Official Build) (x86_64).

The only files I have edited/added are:
<em>script.js</em> (this began blank and the tutorial was to write it)

## Cipher
A class with 2 methods to take a provided numerical value and either:

- encrypt: takes a plain text string and returns a capitalized string with each letter shifted forward in the alphabet based on the set shift value.
- decrypt: takes an encrypted message and returns a lower case string with each letter shifted back in the alphabet based on the set shift value.

Both classes only shift letters and wrap around the end of the alphabet.

## Lodash Project
[Codeacademy lodash project](https://www.codecademy.com/projects/practice/lodash) . This is a light-touch tutorial to recreate some functions from the [lodash.js](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15) library from scratch. This was a good opportunity to practice writing methods in an object, as well as string, array and object methods. I made a point of following the tutorial as loosely as I could, meaning I read only the objectives for each section before starting to plan and code. The project comes with a number of tests, all of which pass.
